# AlmaBetter Quiz App

An app where users can build and play their own questions on a user-friendly quiz platform developed using React.js, Redux Toolkit, and Material UI design. It has responsive design, quiz generation, and an easy-to-use interface. The quiz management is made simple by the admin panel that is part of the platform. This project serves as an example of my ability to create basic web applications and highlights my knowledge in basics of web development.

## Reflection üí†

- This was a 3 week long project built during my second module of Frontend Development at AlmaBetter. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

- Originally I wanted to build an application using _'useReducer'_ hook or _context API_ that I learned in the React Basics classes but went according to the guidelines and learned redux toolkit and implemented in the project.

- One of the main challenges I ran into was _state_ and _payload_. This lead me to spend a few days on a research spike into learning **CRUD** using _redux toolkit_. Due to project time constraints, I had to forgo my idea of implementing a sidebar using _Drawer_ of Material Ui and implementing a Footer that does not hinder the responsiveness.

- I chose to use the `create-react-app quiz-alma-app --template redux` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in countering errors during the project. In the next iteration I plan on using the _ANT-D_ design library and make a _MERN_ app with it.
